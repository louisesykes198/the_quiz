#### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are Code light blue, and light purple.
The colors are simple, with a light blue background (which matches your preference) 
providing a soft, calming effect. This complements a crochet-themed site well.
The text contrasts well with the background, making it easy to read.

Sans Serif serves as the backup font in the event that the Fredoka font cannot be properly imported into the website. 

All icons were sourced though [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

All fonts were sourced through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

The font that I've selected for my website is simple, modern, and extremely readable; it's meant to communicate both professionalism and warmth. 
The headlines' bold, Fredoka font draws attention without being unduly harsh, nicely balancing my hero image's simplicity and clarity. 
The call-to-action and other important places, like my main message, are highlighted by the font's weight.
